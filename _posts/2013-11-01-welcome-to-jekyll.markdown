You'll find this post in your `_posts` directory - edit this post and re-build (or run with the `-w` switch) to see your changes!
To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention: YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}

# Another Header

{% highlight javascript %}
var stuff = "STUFF";

function foo(bar){
	console.log(bar);
	var x = new Object();

	delete x["obj1"];
}

{% endhighlight %}

# Header 1

## Header 2

### Header 3

#### Header 4

##### Header 5

And this time with some text

## Header 2 - It's on!

So Lorem ipsum dolor sit amed and other things that stand here, all very 
important

### Header 3 Man
